# HASBRAIN - Towards Learning-Based Optimal HAS

This repository contains the supplemental material to the paper *Towards Machine Learning-Based Optimal HAS* ([[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08065)). 
In the paper we train machine-learning models for the adaptation of quality in HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) based on the theoretical optimal decisions. 
The trained models are compared against the optimal decisions and two state-of-the-art algorithms in an simulation environment.
